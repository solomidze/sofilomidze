            journey at the age of 3 at the Betz Dan Jewish Cultural Center in
            Kharkiv, Ukraine. Later, under the profound influence of her first
            violin teacher, O. Yevheneva at the Kharkiv Children's Music School,
            Sofi won numerous national and international competitions.

            When the war started in February 2022, Sofi was forced to move to
            Georgia, for safety and continued her education there. Welcomed by
            her father's homeland, she was accepted into the Dina Jayaniâ€™s class
            in Tbilisi Central Music School. She excelled in competitions and
            participated in master classes with esteemed musicians and
            professors such as Prof. Itzhak Rashkovsky(UK), Leonid Zeide

                Sofi is passionate about performing as soloist, believing it to be the best way to connect with people's
            hearts and minds and to uniquely present the beauty of the musical
            language through her artistic mission. She is deeply involved in charity concerts across the
